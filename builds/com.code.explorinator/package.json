  "description": "Code Explorinator is a Unity Plugin that helps you visually explore code. The days of spaghetti code are over! It uses the C# Roslyn compiler to analyze your code within a unity project and displays it as an interactive class diagram. The project is displayed as an UML-like diagram through which you can navigate by scrolling and zooming. An adjustable graph size and a list with all types (classes, structs, interfaces, ...) declared in your code help you get an overview of the project's structure.",
